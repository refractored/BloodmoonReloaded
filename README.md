# Bloodmoon Reloaded

[Discord Support](https://discord.gg/JPez28AJJG)

This plugin was created to replace any issues with the [old plugin](https://github.com/refractored/bloodmoon) i forked.

Bloodmoon itself will just be a libreforge booster applied to all players in that world.

Features like [Hordes](https://github.com/refractored/BloodmoonReloaded/tree/main/extensions/hordes), [Custom Mob drops](https://github.com/refractored/BloodmoonReloaded/tree/main/extensions/drops), [Custom Bosses](https://github.com/refractored/BloodmoonReloaded/tree/main/extensions/bosses),
won't be a part of the base plugin, BUT can be added via extensions I created. All features from the original plugin (except levels) will eventually be made into extensions of its own and will be free.
